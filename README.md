# pico8 prototypes
Recently I've taken interest in learning Lua and the PICO-8 engine. Here I'll post the prototypes I make during this process. They may not be very good or provide much value, but I don't like creating things that just sit on my hardrive and get dusty. So I hope that someone can find even a little bit of value from one of these prototypes.
